        <h2>Shades of grey</h2>
        <img src="assets/shadesofgrey.png" alt="shadesofgrey" width="350px">
        <p>A game to see if you can actually differentiate between 50 uniformly sampled shades of grey. <a href="https://chaitanyachawak.github.io/projects/50shadesofgrey/">Click here</a> to play !</p><br>

        <h2>Masters Project (ongoing)</h2>
        <img src="assets/cosmo1gal.png" alt="cosmo1gal" width="350px">
        <p>I am currently working with <a href="#">Dr. Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro</a> to extract Cosmological and Astrophysical information from the internal properties of a handful of galaxies using Machine Learning techniques. I am learning about new methods like GNNs, and SOMs and how these can be applied in Astrophysics.</p><br>

        <h2>Vez Game</h2>
        <a href="https://chaitanyachawak.github.io/vez_special/"><img src="assets/vez_game.png" alt="vez_game" width="350px"></a>
        <p>Created this as a birthday gift for a dear friend. Can be played <a href="https://chaitanyachawak.github.io/projects/vez_special/">here</a>. (not playable on mobile, yet)</p><br>

        <h2>Galaxy Profiling</h2>
        <img src="assets/NGC3614_MOM2.JPG" alt="NGC3614_MOM2" width="350px">
        <p>Worked on a Python project to extract the galaxy profiles from their images using a deep-learning 'captioning' model (Moment 0, Moment 1 and Moment 2 maps). Involved use of software like SAOds9, and modules like Numpy, Scipy, Astropy, Matplotlib, PyTorch among others.</p><br>

        <h2>Quantum Cloning</h2>
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sDj9q4DejB64ma_TnDyGS7regf5kVcOS/view"><img src="assets/quantum_cloning.png" alt="quantum_cloning" width="350px"></a>
        <p>I discussed the basics of Quantum Cloning like the No-Cloning theorem, along with the designing and working of quantum cloning machines like the universal quantum cloning machine, phase-covariant cloning machine, etc. I also talk about the teleportation scheme, telecloning, various applications, recent developments, and future possibilities in this field.</p><br>

        <h2>Deep Learning for Video Game playing</h2>
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xXCsYw21tRwgO1LEwltgUGVsrB1WtatP/view"><img src="assets/deeplearningvideogame.png" alt="DL_videogame" width="350px"></a>
        <p>I was extremely interested in this topic so decided to read about it as a part of a Data Science project. In this work, I have discussed the application of Deep Learning for classifying and playing different genres of Video Games.</p><br>

        <h2>Gravitational Lensing</h2>
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hFzfmRqXJi5hFs41LyKM94tWBcQvmpPK/view"><img src="assets/grav_lensing.png" alt="grav_lensing" width="350px"></a>
        <p>In this work, I studied about the discovery and the theory of Gravitational Lensing along with its various types and its significance in obtaining information about far away objects.</p><br>

        <h2>Noether's Theorem</h2>
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nlH0OLXo06GOWUoJM-2L5sIomskW0isE/view"><img src="assets/noetherstheorem.png" alt="noetherstheorem" width="350px"></a>
        <p>One of the most beautiful parts in Physics. Here, I have discussed the translational, rotational, and time translation invariances which result from the symmetry of a system. I also discuss its applications in Field Theory, and the derivation of the LRL vector along with the lesser known Second Theorem of Noether.</p><br>

        <h2>Distance Estimation to Galaxies</h2>
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TgxkJYo_Dga1nda4wcbdo4ayVQtwAhng/view"><img src="assets/distance_estimation.png" alt="distance_estimation" width="350px"></a>
        <p>This was one of my first projects. In this, I estimated the distance to the IC348 nebula (which lies in the Perseus constellation) from the Sun. For this, I made use of the parallax and parallax error data obtained from the GAIA database. I also used the The Aladin Sky Atlas to locate the nebula and estimate its radius in arcseconds.</p>
