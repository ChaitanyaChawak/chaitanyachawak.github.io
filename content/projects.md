### Masters Project
![Cosmo1gal](/cosmo1gal.png)
I am currently working with Dr. Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro to extract Cosmological and Astrophysical information from the internal properties of a handful of galaxies using Machine Learning techniques. I am learning about new methods like GNNs, and SOMs and how these can be applied in Astrophysics.

### Galaxy Profiling
![NGC3614_MOM2](/NGC3614_MOM2.JPG)
Worked on a Python project to extract the galaxy profiles from their images using a deep-learning 'captioning' model (Moment 0, Moment 1 and Moment 2 maps). Involved use of software like SAOds9, and modules like Numpy, Scipy, Astropy, Matplotlib, PyTorch among others.

### Quantum Cloning
![quantum_cloning](/quantum_cloning.png)
I discussed the basics of Quantum Cloning like the No-Cloning theorem, along with the designing and working of quantum cloning machines like the universal quantum cloning machine, phase-covariant cloning machine, etc. I also talk about the teleportation scheme, telecloning, various applications, recent developments, and future possibilities in this field.

### Deep Learning for Video Game playing
![deeplearningvideogame](/deeplearningvideogame.png)
I was extremely interested in this topic so decided to read about it as a part of a Data Science project. In this work, I have discussed the application of Deep Learning for classifying and playing different genres of Video Games.

### Gravitational Lensing
![grav_lensing](/grav_lensing.png)
In this work, I studied about the discovery and the theory of Gravitational Lensing along with its various types and its significance in obtaining information about far away objects.

### Noether's Theorem
![noetherstheorem](/noetherstheorem.png)
One of the most beautiful parts in Physics. Here, I have discussed the translational, rotational, and time translation invariances which result from the symmetry of a system. I also discuss its applications in Field Theory, and the derivation of the LRL vector along with the lesser known Second Theorem of Noether.

### Distance Estimation to Galaxies
![distance_estimation](/distance_estimation.png)
This was one of my first projects. In this, I estimated the distance to the IC348 nebula (which lies in the Perseus constellation) from the Sun. For this, I made use of the parallax and parallax error data obtained from the GAIA database. I also used the The Aladin Sky Atlas to locate the nebula and estimate its radius in arcseconds.

# Other fun projects

### Chicagogogo
![chicagogogo](/chicagogogo.png)
Made this pip installable package as a part of Code/Astro 2023. Details can be found [here](https://github.com/ChaitanyaChawak/chicagogogo).

### Shades of Grey
![shades_of_grey](/shadesofgrey.png)
A game to see if you can actually differentiate between 50 uniformly sampled shades of grey. Click [here](/posts/50shadesofgrey/) to play !

### Vez Game
![vez_game](/vez_game.png)
Created this as a birthday gift for a dear friend. Can be played [here](/posts/vez_game/). (unplayable at the moment :/ working on a fix)
