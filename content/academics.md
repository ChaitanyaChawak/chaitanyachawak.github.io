I have done my 5-year integrated BS-MS programme from [IISER Tirupati](http://www.iisertirupati.ac.in/). In my 1st and 2nd years I studied the basics of Physics, Chemistry, Math, Biology, and in the 3rd and 4th years I had all elective courses where I chose Physics as my Major. [This page](/posts/courses/) lists the courses which I took in each of the semesters, with the Math and Physics courses **highlighted**.

For my final year, I worked on my Masters thesis in the field of Computational Astrophysics. Details about this and some of the other projects that I have previously worked on can be found [here](/projects/).
